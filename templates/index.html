<h3>GDP Values (Billions of USD)</h3>
<p>
    Gross domestic product (GDP) is a monetary measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced
    in a specific time period.

<h3>GDP Annual Increases (%)</h3>
<p>

<h3>Balance of Trade (Billions of USD)</h3>
<p>
    The balance of trade, commercial balance, or net exports (sometimes symbolized as NX), is the difference between
    the monetary value of a nation's exports and imports over a certain time period.

<h3>Debt to GDP Ratios (%)</h3>
<p>
    The debt-to-GDP ratio is the ratio between a country's government debt (measured in units of currency) and its gross
    domestic product (GDP) (measured in units of currency per year). A low debt-to-GDP ratio indicates an economy that
    produces and sells goods and services sufficient to pay back debts without incurring further debt.
    A high debt-to-GDP ratio indicates an economy that produces and sells goods and services, but not sufficient enough
    to pay back debts without incurring further debt.

<h3>Interest Rates (%)</h3>
<p>
    In the United States, the federal funds rate is the interest rate at which depository institutions (banks and
    credit unions) lend reserve balances to other depository institutions overnight on an uncollateralized basis.

<h3>Unemployment Rates (%)</h3>
<p>Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate as the number of persons who are unemployed as a percentage of the labour force (the total number of people employed plus unemployed).</p>

<h3>Average Hourly Earnings of All Employees</h3>
<p>
    Average Hourly Earnings.

<h3>Consumer Price Index % Change Over Last Period</h3>
<p>
    The United States Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a set of consumer price indices calculated by the U.S. Bureau of
    Labor Statistics (BLS). To be precise, the BLS routinely computes many different CPIs that are used for different
    purposes. Each is a time series measure of the price of consumer goods and services. The BLS publishes the CPI
    monthly. To simplify, if CPI goes up, the cost of goods and services go up. If the CPI is rising faster than the
    Average Hourly Earnings, it is a sign wages are not keeping up with inflation.
